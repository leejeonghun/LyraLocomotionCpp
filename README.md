# LyraLocomotionCpp


This repository contains C++ implementation of locomotion that has been migrated from [Lyra Starter Game](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/lyra) of Unreal Engine 5.
Except for AnimGraph itself, all of implementations(Anim node functions, state node functions, etc.) were written in C++ for personal learning purposes.
